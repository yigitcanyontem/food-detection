The dataset includes 15657 images.
Food are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
